										Code Park: A New 3D Code Visualization Tool</span>
                                    </h4>


We introduce Code Park, a novel tool for visualizing
codebases in a 3D game-like environment. Code Park aims to
improve a programmer’s understanding of an existing codebase
in a manner that is both engaging and intuitive, appealing to
novice users such as students. It achieves these goals by laying
out the codebase in a 3D park-like environment. Each class in the
codebase is represented as a 3D room-like structure. Constituent
parts of the class (variable, member functions, etc.) are laid out
on the walls, resembling a syntax-aware “wallpaper”. The users
can interact with the codebase using an overview, and a firstperson
viewer mode. We conducted two user studies to evaluate
Code Park’s usability and suitability for organizing an existing
project. Our results indicate that Code Park is easy to get familiar
with and significantly helps in code understanding compared to
a traditional IDE. Further, the users unanimously believed that
Code Park was a fun tool to work with.

										Jackknife: A Reliable Recognizer with Few Samples and Many Modalities</span>
                                    </h4>


Despite decades of research, there is yet no general rapid prototyping
recognizer for dynamic gestures that can be trained
with few samples, work with continuous data, and achieve high
accuracy that is also modality-agnostic. To begin to solve this
problem, we describe a small suite of accessible techniques
that we collectively refer to as the Jackknife gesture recognizer.
Our dynamic time warping based approach for both segmented
and continuous data is designed to be a robust, go-to method
for gesture recognition across a variety of modalities using
only limited training samples. We evaluate pen and touch,
Wii Remote, Kinect, Leap Motion, and sound-sensed gesture
datasets as well as conduct tests with continuous data. Across
all scenarios we show that our approach is able to achieve high
accuracy, suggesting that Jackknife is a capable recognizer
and good first choice for many endeavors.
